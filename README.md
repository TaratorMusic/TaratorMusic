# Memory Efficiency
TaratorMusic only uses 75MB per second of memory while open, 95MB per second while listening to a song, and 125 MB per second while downloading a song. The lightweightness of the app makes it suitable for computers with very low specs. Warning: adding more songs will increase the weight, these values were taken with 0 songs.
