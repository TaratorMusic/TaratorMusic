## Why TaratorMusic?
Aren't you tired of listening to same ten songs in your youtube or spotify playlist ? Too many ads ? What if you want to listen to music offline? This app runs to your aid...

## Technologies Used

Vanilla HTML-CSS-JS for the code, 

ElectronJS to make it a desktop app, 

@distube/ytdl-core and @distube/ytpl libraries for installing youtube videos, thumbnails and playlists.

Better-SQLite3 to store most listened songs and settings data, 

FFmpeg to automatically stabilise audio levels, 

Discord Rich Presence to momentarily share listened songs in Discord,

## How to download:
- Go to the <a href="https://github.com/Victiniiiii/TaratorMusic/releases/latest">releases tab</a> and download whichever version suits your computer.
- .exe files are meant for Windows, AppImage files are meant for linux users. You just need to run them, they are all included.
- Tip for Linux: It will create app folders (musics, playlists, settings etc.) where the AppImage runs, so you can put it in any folder you want and create a .desktop file to run it from the desktop.
- Enjoy!

## Actual Random

## Download Your Own
In this app, you can easily paste a link in the download section, change its name or thumbnail, and press download to make the music and its thumbnail appear in your folders. Works for playlists too! Or you can just carry your own mp3 files to the musics folder.

## Customisation
You can customise everything starting from the app itself, the musics and the playlists. The music files and the playlists can be renamed, and get their thumbnails changed inside the app. The settings tab has a high variety of options on how to change user experience.

## Discord
This app is connected to Discord via Rich Presence. Thus everyone can know you are using TaratorMusic, and what song you are listening to. Although its easily toggleable inside the settings tab if you don't want it.

## Memory Efficiency
TaratorMusic only uses 75MB per second of memory while open, 95MB per second while listening to a song, and 125 MB per second while downloading a song. The lightweightness of the app makes it suitable for computers with very low specs.

## Sound Stabilisation
You can enable and disable the sound stabilisation provided by FFmpeg package. It will help all the songs be near the same volume, eliminating the need to change the volume every new song in case they are too quiet or loud.
