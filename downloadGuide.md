## Windows:
Download the .exe (Don't download the .blockmap, its used to update the app automatically). The .exe is a wizard installer where you can pick the install location, and it will create a desktop shortcut.
## Mac:
I can't test the mac release because i don't have a mac, but it should be working, if anyone tests it let me know!
## Linux:
Download the .AppImage, and place it at the place you want the file directory to be. Then, create a .desktop shortcut for it. When the AppImage launches, it will create AppThumbnails, Musics, Thumbnails etc. folders at the same directory. (So, don't run the AppImage in your desktop.)
## Updating the app:
When a new update is available, the version box at the top right of the main menu will start lighting up. You will be able to see the new content before you choose to update the app. When you update the app for Windows and Mac its updated normally, but for Linux it replaces the whole AppImage.
# ENJOY!
